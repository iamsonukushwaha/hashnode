## What I Learned from Hacktoberfest 2020

I am new to open source and learning programming and new technology.
I have made various projects which are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/flyingsonu122?tab=repositories).

This year I have participated in Hacktoberfest and contributed to many open-source projects.

### Steps

* First of all, check the repositorieswith Hacktoberfest topics

* Check issues with hactoberfest lebel and contributing guidelines

* Ask maintainers to work on that particular issue

* Solve the issue and open a PR

* Do not spam.

that's it.

### Projects on which I contributed

Take a look upon them [Here](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aflyingsonu122+archived%3Afalse+is%3Aclosed)

It was really a good experience; I learnt a lot of new things in open source from [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
