‘Very messy’: India-Canada row over Sikh killing causes diplomatic shock waves Experts say if India was behind Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s death it would signal radical change in its foreign intelligence methods

The sun was setting on a June evening as Hardeep Singh Nijjar walked across the car park of the gurdwara. Nijjar’s day job was as a plumber but this gurdwara, located in the city of Surrey, in Canada’s British Columbia province, was where he dedicated most of his energy. That day he had made an impassioned speech about the fight for an independent, safe state for Sikhs.

But as he reached his pickup truck, two heavy-set, masked gunmen lay in wait. Shots rang out across the car park and Nijjar, killed instantly, crumpled to the ground as the suspects fled – first on foot and then in a getaway car.

Why India’s souring relations with Canada could have wider implications for the west | Chietigj Bajpaee If true, a state-sponsored assassination in British Columbia would suggest a new, brazenly aggressive foreign policy from New Delhi

Canada has not yet offered any definitive evidence of Indian complicity in the killing of a Sikh separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in British Columbia in June. The prime minister Justin Trudeau’s recent parliamentary statement noted credible “allegations” of a “potential” Indian link to the assassination. But putting aside the veracity of Canada’s claims, the downturn in Indo-Canadian relations points to signs of a more assertive Indian foreign policy.

India has been in the geopolitical spotlight over the past year, as evidenced by it hosting the G20 summit in New Delhi earlier this month. It has surpassed China in population and the UK in GDP. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has received a red-carpet welcome in several capitals, most notably Washington in June. The contrast between China’s struggling economy and forecasts that India will be the world’s fastest-growing major economy this year could not be starker.

War in Ukraine is revealing a new global order – and the ‘power south’ is the winner | Nathalie Tocci Long-held resentments of the west are surfacing as world relations rebalance in favour of economic powerhouses like India and China

It came as an unpleasant surprise to many in Europe and North America that so many countries – many more than the 30 or so that abstained in UN votes condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine – refused to go along with sanctions on Putin’s Russia. Forty countries sanction Russia, but two-thirds of the world’s population live in countries that do not.

The geopolitical split over Russia’s war on Ukraine emerged starkly again at the recent G20 summit in India in early September. A consensus could only be reached on a watered-down statement that referred to the “war in Ukraine” without mentioning Russia’s aggression.

Israeli ambassador protests as Iranian president speaks - as it happened The United Nations general assembly liveblog is now closed, but please see the following stories to stay on top of the day’s news:

Zelenskiy accuses Russia of genocide and urges world leaders to attend peace summit World inching ever closer to a great fracture, says UN chief Guterres says countries such as Russia are creating a “world of insecurity” for everyone following its invasion of Ukraine, which he says has “unleashed the next phase of our lives: historic human rights abuse, families torn apart, children traumatised, hopes and dreams shattered.”

The war in Ukraine has “serious implications” for the world beyond Kyiv, he says, pointing to the collapse of the Black Sea grain initiative.

The world badly needs Ukrainian food and Russian food and fertilisers to stabilise markets and guarantee food security.

Sudan is descending into full scale civil war. Millions have fled and the country risks splitting apart.

In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, millions are displaced and gender based violence is a horrific daily reality in a country that suffered centuries of colonial exploitation, is today overwhelmed by gang violence and still awaits international support.

Authoritarianism is on the march, inequalities are growing, and hate speech is on the rise.

What we need is determination and determination which is in the DNA of our United Nations, summoning gods with the first words of the charter.

We the peoples of the United Nations, determined, determined to end the scourge of war, determined to reaffirm faith in human rights, determined to uphold justice and respect international law and determined to promote social progress and better lives for all people.

The Guardian view on Canada and India: from partnership to public claims of a killing | Editorial Whatever the truth about the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the row shows that building relationships with New Delhi won’t be easy

Canada made waves when it recently announced an inquiry into potential foreign election interference. Its tanking relations with China have been watched closely, not least for how they reflect upon other western countries’ dealings with Beijing. Russia’s activities were also under scrutiny. Fewer people noticed that ministers also cited the potential role of the Indian government.

The decision looks like a ripple in a millpond following Justin Trudeau’s extraordinary statement that Canada is pursuing “credible allegations” of a potential link between New Delhi and the murder of a Canadian national, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in British Columbia this June. Nijjar had campaigned for an independent Sikh nation – known as Khalistan – to be created from Punjab state. Indian authorities had accused him of terrorism, and issued a bounty for his arrest. Canada’s spy agency had reportedly warned him of threats.
